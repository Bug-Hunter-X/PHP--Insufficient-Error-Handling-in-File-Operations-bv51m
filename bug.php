```php
$file = fopen("path/to/file.txt", "r");
if ($file) {
    // Process the file
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error
    echo "Error opening file.";
}
```
This code has a potential bug.  If the `fopen()` function fails (e.g., due to insufficient permissions or the file not existing), `$file` will be `false`.  The `if ($file)` check will evaluate to `false`, and the error handling will execute. However, the error handling is basic and doesn't provide any information about *why* the file could not be opened.  More robust error handling is needed, including checking `error_get_last()` to retrieve the specific error message from PHP.

Additionally, there's no explicit error handling for `fclose()`. While less likely, `fclose()` can also return `false` if there's an issue closing the file. Ignoring this return value is not best practice.
