# PHP: Insufficient Error Handling in File Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: inadequate error handling when working with files.  The `bug.php` file shows a basic example of opening a file with minimal error handling.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides an improved version with more robust error checking.

**Problem:** The original code only checks if the file opened successfully but doesn't provide detailed error information if the opening fails. It also omits error handling for the `fclose()` function.

**Solution:** The improved code utilizes `error_get_last()` to get the system's error message and provides more descriptive feedback to the user. It also includes explicit error handling for the file closing operation.

This example highlights the importance of meticulous error handling in PHP applications for improved reliability and debugging capabilities.
